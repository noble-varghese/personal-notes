## What Drives Me

- **Backend Engineering**: There's something magical about creating the invisible engines that power the web.
- **Infrastructure**: I love architecting systems that can scale and stand the test of time (and traffic!).
- **Open Source**: Contributing to projects that shape the future of tech? Count me in!

## What You'll Find Here
- [Posts](/posts): a selection of my longer-form writing and thoughts
- [Notes](/notes): where I write about things I’m working on and exploring. They’re not supposed to be as high-quality as a post, but I’ll be publishing them much more often.


## Projects & Contributions

I believe in the power of community-driven development. Here are some open-source projects I've had the privilege to contribute to:

- [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)
- [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index)
- [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)

## Professional Journey

My career has been a thrilling ride through the startup ecosystem:
Each role has been a stepping stone, allowing me to hone my skills in Python, Node.js/TypeScript, and Go. I've learned that in the world of startups, adaptability is just as crucial as technical prowess.
