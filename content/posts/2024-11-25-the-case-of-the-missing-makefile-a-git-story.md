Imagine this: your CI/CD pipeline fails with a cryptic error message. Everything works perfectly on your local machine. The Makefile is present, the commands are valid, and there’s no apparent issue. Yet, the deployment fails repeatedly. What’s going on?

# Context

My Python services were deployed using GitLab CI/CD. Locally, everything ran smoothly: the Makefile was present, and the commands executed without issue. However, during deployment, the logs revealed this surprising message:

```bash
make: No rule to make target 'install'. Stop.
```

Confused, I dug into the GitLab CI logs and noticed something strange:

```bash
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 3997 Nov 25 09:02 MakeFile
```

Hold on—_MakeFile_ with a capital "F"? But on my local machine, the file was named _Makefile_ with a lowercase "f." How did this happen?



# The Root Cause

The problem stemmed from how Git handles case sensitivity across different operating systems:

## 1. Local Development (macOS/Windows)

- **Case-insensitive filesystems**: By default, macOS and Windows treat filenames like _Makefile_, _MAKEFILE_, and _MakeFile_ as identical.
- Everything worked locally because the filesystem didn’t care about the case.

## 2. Deployment Environment (Linux)

- **Case-sensitive filesystems**: On Linux, filenames are treated as distinct based on case. _Makefile_ and _MakeFile_ are completely different files.
- The `make` command specifically looks for _Makefile_ (lowercase).

Because my deployment environment was case-sensitive, it couldn’t find the file it needed, leading to the failure.



# The Solution

The fix was straightforward:

1. Remove the incorrectly cased file from Git’s index:

   ```bash
   git rm --cached MakeFile
   ```

2. Add the correctly cased file:

   ```bash
   git add Makefile
   ```

3. Commit the change:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: correcting Makefile case sensitivity"
   ```

After pushing these changes, the pipeline worked flawlessly.



# Lessons Learned

1. **Case Sensitivity Matters**  
   Always follow conventional naming practices for files, especially well-known ones like _Makefile_ or _README.md_.

2. **Cross-Platform Awareness**  
   Be mindful that your development environment may behave differently from your deployment environment. What works on a case-insensitive system might fail on a case-sensitive one.

3. **Git Configuration**  
   Git’s `core.ignorecase` setting can mask these issues in development. Ensure it’s configured appropriately for your workflow.
   ```bash
   git config core.ignorecase
   ```
   If this returns true, Git is treating filenames as case-insensitive.



# Best Practices

To prevent similar problems in the future:

1. **Use Consistent Naming Conventions**  
   Stick to lowercase filenames wherever possible, and avoid using camelCase for file names. Use hyphens or underscores instead.

2. **Test in Case-Sensitive Environments**  
   Always test your deployments in an environment that mimics your production setup, especially regarding filesystem case sensitivity.

3. **Add Case Sensitivity Checks**  
   Consider implementing checks in your CI pipeline to catch case-related issues before deployment.



# Closing Thoughts

Just because your code works on your machine doesn’t mean it will work everywhere. Understanding the quirks of your deployment environment can save you from hours of troubleshooting. Always think beyond your local setup and design with portability in mind.
