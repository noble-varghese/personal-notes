Text expanders are powerful productivity tools that allow users to create shortcuts that expand into longer pieces of text. In this ongoing series, I'll document my journey of building a text expander in Go, sharing both the technical challenges and solutions I encounter along the way.

## Project Goals

- Create a lightweight, cross-platform text expander
- Build an efficient snippet management system
- Implement real-time text expansion
- Design a user-friendly configuration system
- Keep the codebase maintainable and well-tested

## Getting Started

I'm starting with a simple architecture that consists of three main components. 
- A keyboard event listener to detect the typed shortcuts
- A snippet manager (basically a file that stores the snippets)
- An expansion engine that converts the shortcuts to complete text.


<!-- ## Next Steps
In the upcoming posts, I'll cover:

- Implementing keyboard event listening in Go
- Building a persistent storage system for snippets
- Creating an efficient matching algorithm
- Handling special cases (e.g., formatting, variables) -->


## Development Log
### Week 1: Project Setup
**Dec 12th, 2024:**

- Set up the basic project structure
- Implemented initial snippet management system
- Started research on cross-platform keyboard event handling
- Make it brew installable and add the documentation for the installation details.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions
This section will be updated as challenges are encountered and solved
Lessons Learned
This section will be populated as the project progresses

## Future Plans

- Add support for dynamic expansions (date, time, custom variables)
- Implement a GUI for snippet management
- Add cloud sync capabilities
- Create a plugin system for custom expansions
